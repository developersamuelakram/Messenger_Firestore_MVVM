##Chat App - Java built - Firestore, ,MVVM, Navigation

This app is built on MVVM architecture. Most of the ChatApps are built with Kotlin and there is almost no reference for the beginners to look. I was stuck on how do I create specific chatroom
for each user because anyone can query data from firestore with MVVM approach but in ChatApp this becomes challenging. You are quering the same collection but displaying 
documents only of two users of who are chatting. Anyways being stuck on this thing and finally coming out of it after one month has been a uplifiting journey. 

This app has. 

1. Progress Dialog
2. Gallery and Camera Intent
3. Firestore, Firebasestorage, FirebaseAuthentication
4. Recyclerview. 
5. MVVM
6. Navigation and much more.
